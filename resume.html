        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>After 20+ years in the hospitality industry I felt now was a good time to make a change and try my hand at something I've always
        been interested and fascinated with: software and web developement. After many years in management I know the importance of knowing
        when to lead, follow, and collaborate. I'm looking to join a dynamic team where I can learn, develope, and grow to the benefit of myself
        and the team.
